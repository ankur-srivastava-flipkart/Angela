My Intelligent Personal Assistant

Requirement

The idea is to have a personal assistant which can follow you and take orders.

"Follow You" => have some camera recognition ability and move with you maintaining a safe distance.
"take orders" => 
    1. write/email things for you.
    2. Record voice / video.
    3. Access contact directory and dial phone for you.
    
    
Initial Design -
 
 1. Have a remote toy car.
 2. Strip open the remote and connect it to a raspberry pi (somehow)
 3. Bind the pi (with camera) and a powerbank on top of the car.
 4. Start writing code to recognize motion and identify people.
 5. Do the pi to remote interfacing and control the car motion.
 6. Have a audio interface in pi and listen to voice. Probably use google assistant API for voice recognition. 
 7. Execute the commands.
